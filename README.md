### Projects

- **ChatBot Application**
  - Developed a full-stack chatbox application that integrates with the OpenAI API to simulate interactive conversations. The application features dynamic user and bot interactions, with real-time response animations that mimic typing behavior. The project focuses on enhancing user engagement through responsive design and smooth asynchronous operations.
  - Technologies Used: Node.js, Express, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, OpenAI API

  - Designed and implemented an Arduino-based temperature and humidity monitoring system with real-time data display on an LCD. The system uses a DHT11 sensor to track conditions, triggering different LEDs and buzzers at specific temperature thresholds: a blue LED for temperatures below 25°C, a green LED for 25°C to 30°C, a yellow LED for 30°C to 35°C with an active buzzer, and a red LED above 35°C accompanied by both active and passive buzzers. The project provided accurate real-time monitoring and clear visual and audio feedback for various temperature levels.
  - Technologies Used: Arduino IDE, Circuit Design

- **Bank Account Application**
  - Developed a Bank Account Application designed for both Managers and Customers, featuring tiered privileges based on account balance and secure data management. The application includes key banking functionalities such as authentication, transaction management, and account balance tracking, with distinct benefits for different privilege levels. Secure authentication protocols and role-based access management were implemented to ensure data security and efficient account administration, resulting in a robust, user-friendly application for banking operations.
  - Technologies Used: JavaFX, Java, Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- **Simple General-Purpose Processor**
  - Collaborated with a team and designed a Simple Processor using VHDL on an FPGA board. The processor comprised four key components: a Storage Unit with 8-bit registers, an ALU core, a Control Unit with a Finite State Machine (FSM) and a 4:16 decoder, and Seven Segment Display units. The microcoded ALU output was displayed on the Seven Segment Display, providing a visual representation of the results. The project demonstrated the effective integration of VHDL components, resulting in a functional processor with clear visual feedback.
  - Technologies Used: VHDL, Logic Gates, Design, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)

- **Prototype Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with LED and Buzzer Alert System**
- ![Prototype Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with LED and Buzzer Alert System](assets/ultrasensor.jfif)
  - Developed a hands-on electronics project that features a prototype Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with a real-time LED and Buzzer Alert System using Arduino. The system detects objects within a 1-foot range, activating corresponding LEDs to indicate proximity. A green LED lights up within 12 inches, a yellow LED within 8 inches, and a red LED with an audible buzzer within 4 inches. The project incorporated a smoothing algorithm to average sensor readings, reducing noise and preventing false triggers, resulting in a responsive and accurate alert system.
